This study leveraged plasma proteomic data from 52,879 participants in the UK Biobank to systematically investigate associations between protein expression profiles and waist circumference (WC). We developed a proteomics-based model to predict WC and derived a proteomic biological waist circumference (proWC). We further evaluated the performance of WC, proWC, and proWCΔ in relation to risks of incident diseases and mortality.

For the dietary analysis, we included intake frequencies of commonly consumed foods and beverages and used multivariable linear regression to assess their associations with WC, proWC, and proWCΔ. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the potential mediating roles of proteins in the relationships between WC, proWC, and proWCΔ and disease outcomes. In addition, we applied Cox proportional hazards models incorporating restricted cubic splines to examine nonlinear dose–response relationships of WC and proWC with disease incidence and mortality, and performed stratified modeling across subgroups defined by sex, age, and BMI to assess heterogeneity of associations.
