proWC explained 85.8% of the variance in measured WC and highlighted immune/inflammatory biology. We also defined a residual metric (proWCA = proWC − WC) to capture metabolic variation independent of physical size. proWCA identified “discordant” individuals—especially those with low measured WC but high proWC—who showed distinct protein signatures and substantially higher risk of several incident diseases (notably nervous system, respiratory, and mental/behavioural disorders) that WC alone missed. For mortality, proWC showed a stronger J-shaped association (including particularly high diabetes-related death risk), while proWCA showed a U-shaped pattern. Overall, combining proWC with conventional WC improves disease/mortality risk stratification and flags high-risk subgroups overlooked by anthropometry alone.
